# SSP Dialect Rationale

This document describes various design points of the SSP dialect, why they are
the way they are, and current status.  This follows in the spirit of other
[MLIR Rationale docs](https://mlir.llvm.org/docs/Rationale/).

## Introduction

The SSP dialect represents instances of **S**tatic **S**cheduling **P**roblems. It is designed as a companion to CIRCT's [scheduling infrastructure](https://circt.llvm.org/docs/Scheduling/), and intended to serve as MLIR-native import/export format for rapid prototyping, benchmarking, and testing of problem definitions and algorithm implementations.
